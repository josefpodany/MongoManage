# MongoManage
This is a repository for a secondary school-leaving work regarding MongoDB and scripts for managing instances and data.

## TODOS:
### Running Beta:
* logs and data directories
* create list of shards
* running mongos over shards
* create replica sets of shards
* have dynamic range of ports

### V1:
* first import/export scripts
* backups with cron, shutting down least used replicas etc.
* create HOW-TOs in markdown

### Bonus:
* HTML or some sort of GUI or interactive CLI
* CLI or HTML overview of all running instances, data etc.
